# Why this playbook

# Where it is come from


# What it is
We have a process, and a set of ready-partly-filled spreadsheets/tables/templates to help people write their own risk assessment.

The process has now been developed a bit further using a common western military threat assessment, to give us a reasonably systematic approach; that is a way of breaking the problem down, re-assembling it, and being reasonably rigorous. Or at least as rigorous as we need to be.

The playbook is in written form with some explanation videos and a few worked examples.
