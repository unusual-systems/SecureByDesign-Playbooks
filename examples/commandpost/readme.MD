# Defending Command Posts
## Background
"Command Posts" here are fielded headquarter organisations of ground forces. For example, a Forward Operating Base or Patrol Base. 
It typically has poor communication links with limited, intermittent and often contested connections to other force elements. 
Channels vary widely from opportunistic use of local infrastructure, embedded/organic radios, local fibre cables and satellite links back to national strategic support.
